# Concordance
This is an indexing	style	used by	scholars and which was once	often	available	for	
some important books	and some websites. The idea is the concordance	
permits	you	to read	or see a	word that has been indexed in its	original context, as	
this can	often	aid	the	reader to	decide whether or not the	reference is indeed	what	
they want or need.

The modules used are sys, regex and fileinput. The input can given through both stdin and
through a file name.

I have designed the simillar program in C as well. It is impleted using linked-list and
dynamic memory allocation, and further has no mermory leaks as of now.

There are some Testcases provided as well, designed by Dr. Zastre.
