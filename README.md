# Concordance
This is an indexing	style	used by	scholars and which was once	often	available	for	
some important books	and some websites. The idea is the concordance	
permits	you	to read	or see a	word that has been indexed in its	original context, as	
this can	often	aid	the	reader to	decide whether or not the	reference is indeed	what	
they want or need.

The modules used are sys, regex and fileinput.
